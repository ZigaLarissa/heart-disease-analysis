# FORMATIVE ASSIGNMENT

## Heart Disease Dataset Analysis


I am a data scientist working for a healthcare company, and my task is to analyze a dataset of medical records to identify patients with high risk of developing heart disease. I will use unsupervised learning techniques to cluster patients based on their medical history and identify risk factors associated with heart disease.

I will be using the heart disease dataset from the UCI Machine Learning Repository.It should contain 303 instances with 14 attributes (including age, sex, chest pain type, blood pressure, serum cholesterol, and target variable indicating the presence or absence of heart disease)

My task is to perform the following steps:

- Load the heart disease dataset into a pandas data frame and perform exploratory data analysis (EDA) to gain insights into the dataset.
- Preprocess the dataset by handling missing values, scaling the features, and encoding categorical variables.
Apply
- K-means clustering
- Optimize for the number of ks in k means clusterings
 Hierarchical clustering, and
- DBSCAN clustering
 to the preprocessed dataset to group patients into clusters based on their medical history.


Use principal component analysis (PCA) and t-SNE to visualize the clusters and gain insights into the relationships between the variables. I must state conclusions drawn from this step

Use Gaussian mixture models (GMMs) to identify risk factors associated with heart disease.
Evaluate the clustering performance using metrics such as silhouette score and Davies-Bouldin index.
Compare the performance of different clustering algorithms and choose the one that gives the best results.
NB - there must be a text in the notebook that Determines which clustering algorithm works best and the reasons
